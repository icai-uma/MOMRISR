# Multiobjective optimization of deep neural networks for super-resolution
This repository contains the modified SRCNN3D model described in the paper "Multiobjective optimization of deep neural networks for super-resolution"

It was developed using the SRCNN3D and DCSRN models, so the following instructions to install each repository, and use our scripts to execute the code.
